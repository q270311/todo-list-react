## Description 
Project implemented during the _Frontend Developer od podstaw_ course at the **YouCode** -  online programming school.

The web application allows you to save tasks to be done in the near future on the board. For example, it could be words that need to be learned in another language.

Short description of the program's functionality:

Enter the content of the task into the "Dodaj nowe zadanie" field and confirm it with the "enter" key or click the "Dodaj zadanie" button.
The green button, to the left of the task, allows you to mark the task as done.
Each task can be removed from the board at any time, by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the task.
By clicking on the content of the task, we go to the subpage containing the details of the task.
The search engine allows you, to find tasks that contain a specific phrase.
Completed tasks may be invisible - after pressing the "Ukryj ukończone".
The "Ukończ wszystkie" button, marks all tasks as completed.
At any time, you can download sample tasks, by clicking "Pobierz przykładowe zadania".
The "o autorze" tab, contains information about the author of the project.

## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
